# Renderer fonts

These fonts are loaded only by GQY's long-image renderer worker. The worker
starts with the CJK font and adds the Emoji font only for content that needs it.
They are installed under `/usr/share/gqy/fonts` so rendering is deterministic
and never needs to scan host fonts. Development builds read this directory in
the source tree. `GQY_RENDERER_FONTS_DIR` can override the location for
portable builds.
